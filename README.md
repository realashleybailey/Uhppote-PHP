<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

My aim here stems from lots of fruastration from attempting to use other ACL software, and though they have all the functions they never utilize them in any meaningfull way, so thats why I am building Uhppote PHP, a project aimed to give a Advanced UI that will let you control, view and modify your Uhppote ACL unit.

Here's why:
* Ease of use with your access control unit
* Friendly user interface that will port many functions that you would previously have to use bad software to view or edit
* Why PHP, well we all know PHP is the best language out there ;), all jokes aside PHP is great for this because it can be run anywhere and with it being an open face server with a UI you will be able to access it from anywhere on your network or if your brave enough to face it to the WWW then anywhere in the world, however we advise to only run this software behind a secure firewall
